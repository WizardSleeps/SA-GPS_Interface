# SA-GPS_Interface
N/D for double integration of Accelerometer data

# Overview:
The DNN system will be integrated into the aircraft computer system along with the INS. It is constantly # updated based on outcomes of the trained model and it also learns new trails and provide navigational routes.

# DNN Overview
The DNN is a feed-forward connectionist model builtout of successive pairs of convolutional and maxpooling layers, followed by several fully connected layers. One of the advantages of DNNs over common alternatives for supervised image classification is generality.

# View Method
Using KBNS Method for the estimator corrector mechanism, leads to the optimal estimation of linearized system and measurement system model.
 
# Conclusion: This focuses on Y-Axis change along with devaluing
